The final version of the project is: nullpointer exception??

This version does not have jar files, due to an error when making a runnable jar.

ClientPi can be setup as a server and as a client.
1. Client: the client can be started with the portnumber set to 6667.

2. Server: in the code the port need to another number. This needs to be done manually in the code itself.

There is a testfile available for dowloading.
